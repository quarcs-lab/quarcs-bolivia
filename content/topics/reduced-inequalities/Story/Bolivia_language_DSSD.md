Bolivia is a country rich in cultural diversity, with a population that speaks more than 36 different languages. Despite Spanish being the official language, there are many indigenous languages spoken throughout the country, such as Quechua, Aymara, Guarani, and others. In some municipalities, the non-Spanish speaking population is quite significant, with some areas having over 90% of the population speaking a language other than Spanish. This diversity is part of what makes Bolivia unique, but it also presents unique challenges for the country.

One intriguing finding in Bolivia is that municipalities with large non-Spanish speaking populations, who are primarily indigenous, tend to have lower values for UN SDG 10 - which is focused on reducing inequality within and between countries. A scatter plot showing this trend uses the value of UN SDG 10 on the y-axis and the percentage of non-Spanish speakers in a municipality on the x-axis. The scatter plot clearly demonstrates an inverse relationship between the two variables, with municipalities with higher percentages of non-Spanish-speaking populations having lower values for UN SDG 10. This suggests that there may be more inequality in these areas due to linguistic barriers or discrimination.

When we contrast SDG 10 values for the municipalities with the highest and lowest percentages of non-Spanish speakers, the contrast is even more pronounced.

The geographical distribution of the non-Spanish speaking population can be seen from the map below.

The map on the left uses a color gradient to depict non-Spanish speaking populations across Bolivia’s municipalities, with a higher level of non-Spanish speakers represented by the lighter shades. Similarly, the map on the right shows the literacy rate in each municipality using a color gradient, with darker shades indicating lower levels of literacy.

It is apparent that the areas with large non-Spanish speaking populations and low literacy rates are concentrated in the central region of the country. This suggests that there may be systemic challenges in the education system that are preventing individuals from acquiring the skills and knowledge they need to succeed.

Furthermore, this overlap between non-Spanish speaking populations and low literacy rates could also contribute to the challenges faced by these communities in achieving UN SDG 10. Limited access to education can make it difficult for individuals to acquire the skills and knowledge needed to improve their economic and social well-being, perpetuating inequality and exclusion.




To gain a better understanding of the impact of language barriers on healthcare outcomes, a bar chart comparing infant mortality rates is used. The chart compares the top 10 municipalities with the highest percentage of non-Spanish speakers against the bottom 10 municipalities, based on infant mortality rate.

The bar chart shows that the average infant mortality rate is higher in the municipalities with the highest percentage of non-Spanish speakers than it is in the municipalities without. This indicates that individuals in non-Spanish-speaking communities face additional difficulties in obtaining and receiving high-quality healthcare and that language barriers may be contributing to disparities in healthcare outcomes.

These findings are particularly concerning given the importance of reducing infant mortality as a key objective of UN SDG 3. Improving access to quality healthcare services is essential for achieving this goal, and language barriers may be contributing to the challenges faced by individuals in non-Spanish-speaking communities.

To gain a better understanding of the impact of language barriers on educational outcomes, a bar chart comparing the Gini coefficient of years of education is used. 

The Gini coefficient is a measure of inequality. A higher Gini coefficient of years of education indicates greater inequality in access to education, with some individuals having significantly more years of education than others. This can result in disparities in employment opportunities, income, and social mobility, among other factors. 

A Gini coefficient of 0 represents perfect equality, where everyone has the same level of education, while a coefficient of 1 indicates perfect inequality, where one person has all the education and everyone else has none. The municipalities with a High % of non-Spanish speakers have a much great Gini coefficient, 0.549, than the ones with a low % of non-Spanish speakers, 0.34.

Similarly, the graph shows that municipalities with the highest percentage of non-Spanish speakers have a higher average Gini coefficient of years of education compared to the municipalities that have a lower percentage of non-Spanish speakers. This indicates that language barriers may be contributing to disparities in access to education and educational outcomes, with individuals in non-Spanish-speaking communities facing additional challenges in accessing and succeeding in education.

These findings are particularly concerning given the importance of reducing educational inequality as a key objective of UN SDG 4, which is about quality education. Improving access to quality education is essential for achieving this goal, and language barriers may be contributing to the challenges faced by individuals in non-Spanish-speaking communities.

In conclusion, Bolivia's population of non-Spanish speakers faces difficulties in achieving a number of UN Sustainable Development Goals, including income inequality, access to and quality of education, and disparities in healthcare. To increase universal access to high-quality healthcare, education and all human rights outcomes, it is important to consider language. 

In order for Bolivia to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals, policymakers and stakeholders must work to build a more diverse and equitable society that benefits all citizens, regardless of their ethnicity or first language.
