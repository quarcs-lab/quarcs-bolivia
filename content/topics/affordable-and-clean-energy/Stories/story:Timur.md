## **Varibles Used :**


| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| mun | Municipality |
| sdg7_3_co2epc | CO2 emissions per capita by energy, 2016. (tCO2/person/year) |
| sdg7_1_rec | Residential electricity consumption per capita, 2016 (kWh/person/year) |
| sdg7_1_ec | Electricity coverage, 2012 (% of population) |

Bolivia is a country with diverse climate regions that present challenges for providing electricity to all corners of the country. Three key variables were examined in this analysis. First, electricity coverage in 2012 was found to be widespread across the country. Second, residential electricity consumption per capita was found to be highest in Tarija, Beni, and Santa Cruz, which are located in tropical and savanna climate zones. In contrast, the southwest region appeared to have lower consumption due to low population density, underdeveloped infrastructure, and limited availability of electrical appliances. Third, CO2 emissions per capita by energy were highest in Santa Cruz, highlighting the need for targeted efforts to reduce emissions.

Despite widespread access to electricity, power outages remain a challenge in Bolivia. The country's electricity supply is largely based on hydropower, making electricity shortages and power outages more likely during periods of drought or low water levels in reservoirs. Additionally, the country's electricity infrastructure is not as well-developed as in some other countries.

{{< paragraph class="large" >}}
The geographical and climatic diversity in Bolivia present challenges in ensuring reliable and equitable access to electricity. The data on electricity consumption by region and CO2 emissions per capita underscore the importance of considering regional differences in energy access and consumption when formulating energy policies.
