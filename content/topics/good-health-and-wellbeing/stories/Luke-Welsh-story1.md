I see a variety of features that are closely correlated. I can interpret these features in different groups.

First, the indexes (SDG1 & SDG3 Indexes, and Bolivia Index Ranking) are likely to be created from other variables, which I am unable to find information on. I can speculate that the variables used to create the indexes may be the best predictors for Child Mortality Rate. However, without knowing what goes in, I should not look further into this.

Next, Infant Mortality Rate should not be used as those numbers will be directly included into Child Mortality Rate. This relationship will not provide us with much insight as the same causes of infant mortality will also influence child mortality.

This leaves us with Institutional Childbirth Coverage, Household w/o toilet, etc., Obesity in Women, Access to the 3 Basic Services, Non-Spanish Speaking Population, and Coord_X. 

To interpret these, in locations where childbirth coverage or access to the 3 basic services increases, child mortality decreases. This makes sense that additional services lead to a greater survival rate. 

Coord_X's correlation explains that the western side of Bolivia faces greater child mortality. This may be due to geographical features, as the West of Bolivia is very mountainous.

Finally, the remaining features offer insights to high correlations between Child Mortality Rate and low amounts of toilets, etc., less obesity in women, and high non-spanish speaking populations. We can estimate from this that populations facing the most child mortality will likely consist of low spanish speaking populations, low obesity rates, and low amounts of toilets in houses. 

A glaring omitted variable that is likely playing a role in all of these correlations is wealth of the communities as wealthier communities often face more obesity, have more toilets, and may also speak more Spanish. However, it is interesting to note that none of the poverty variables had high correlations with Child Mortality, so maybe the variables listed above have a more closely connected relationship than poverty in general.
