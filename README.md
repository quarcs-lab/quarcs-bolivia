QuaRCS Bolivia is a project developed by [DSSD](https://dssdglobal.org/) in conjunction with [QuaRCS lab](https://quarcs-lab.org/). The mission of the project is to allow researchers and university students to easily access and contribute to a Bolivia geographical dataset. 

This Bolivia geographical dataset sources from the [Municipal Atlas of the Sustainable Development Goals in Bolivia 2020](https://sdsnbolivia.org/Atlas/). 

The QuaRCS lab have used this dataset in their research, and would like to extend this dataset's reach to others interested in contributing their own analysis towards this dataset. Links to their research can be found below:
